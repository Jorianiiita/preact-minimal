# :rocket: preact-minimal 
Minimal preact structure. 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aganglada/preact-minimal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aganglada/preact-minimal)

### Motivation

[preact](https://github.com/developit/preact) is just soooooo fast! :zap: :zap: :zap: But when 
you have an idea and want to start coding right away, then it becomes really hard and time 
consuming to setup and have your application ready to start your development.

**preact-minimal** comes to save your time providing you with the minimal and sufficient kit of
tools you need.
